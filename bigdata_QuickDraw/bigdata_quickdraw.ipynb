    "**\"Quick Draw!\"** is an online game developed by Google Creative Lab that guesses the drawing as the player draws the given image. It was observed that majority of the sketches were guessed after the second stroke, but the game may need up to more than 10 strokes before being guessed correctly. It was also found that within the dataset, only 12.01% of the sketches were guessed upon completion of the first stroke. With this, this study aims to answer the question: **Can Quick, Draw! sketches be identified given only the first stroke?**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Quick Draw! dataset used was obtained from Kaggle with size of 53.1 GB of data composed of 36 million drawings under 82 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology involves data preprocessing using the AWS platform and use of dask library functions, exploratory data analysis and model development. We developed two models, (1) without grouping and (2) with grouping which places those that have an f-1 score of less than 0.3 in a single group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results show that for without and with grouping, we obtained accuracy of 25.13% and 75.19%, This is higher than the computed 1.25xPCC of 2.11% and 68.13%. Comparing this to Quick Draws AI!'s performance in guessing sketches correctly after the first at 12.01%, our models were able to outperform this even without grouping at 25.13%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the model can be integrated to Quick, Draw!’s underlying neural network to improve its speed in guessing a sketch. For future studies, we recommend the following:\n",
    "1. Expand the dataset by using other categories on the original dataset.\n",
    "2. Use of different neural networks as model architectures might improve the model's performance.\n",
    "3. Aside from prediction, auto completion of sketches can be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will be valuable in the future of sketch prediction. We imagine using a single sketch as an input that would prompt possible recommendations to the user. Additionally, with the increasing use of smart phones and touch devices, this will also be useful to educators and students by speeding up the sketching process and focusing more on the lesson at hand."

    "The **Quick, Draw!** game is a game invented by Jonas Jongejan, Henry Rowley, Takashi Kawashima, Jongmin Kim, Nick Fox-Gieg, of the Google Creative Lab$^1$. A player is given a maximum of 20 seconds to draw an object such as apple, zebra, clock, or paper clip. The game relies on the data provided by previous players to learn more about the objects being drawn. One important feature of these sketches is the drawing stroke, which is defined as a continuous line before lifting the pen or writing material. Data on this includes the location and length of the stroke as well as the time it takes to draw the stroke.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Quick, Draw! utilizes neural networks to quickly guess the object being drawn, and players are amazed at how fast these images are being guessed, sometimes even before the 20 seconds are up, and sometimes even before the sketch is finished. While the Quick, Draw! game shows impressive results as it guesses the objects being drawn, it was found that only 13% of the sketches were guessed upon completion of the first stroke. Majority of the sketches were guessed after the second stroke but images can take up to more than 10 strokes before being guessed correctly. \n",

    "Even though our model already outperforms the 1.25 PCC, we also explored how to further improve its performance by grouping the categories that resulted to an f-1 score lower than 0.3. This evaluation metric was chosen as the basis for grouping as it accounts for both precision and recall which is its harmonic mean. The choice of f-1 score threshold is arbitrary. The intuition behind such action is that some classes have low f-1 score which means that first stroke sketches under such classes might be difficult to identify. Thus, they are wrongly classified to be under other classes. This also affects the f-1 score of other classes. Hence, placing classes with low f-1 score into a single placeholder may mitigate the issue of numerous wrongly classified sketches."

    "After tagging the objects  under classes with low f-1 score in the previous step as `others`, the number of categories is now **18** including the `others` category.  We then again develop a model using this dataset and the `validate_clf` function to find the performance of the classification model on a *less noisy* data. With this, we arrived at an accuracy of $75.19\\%$, significantly higher than the previous accuracy without grouping. The intuition behind the significant increase in accuracy is that sketches that are hard to classify tend to fall under the `others` class. This means that there are some classes whose elements are recognizable even just with the first stroke."
